\section{The Nearest Neighbour algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Is k-NN more likely to overfit when k is large or small?\\

        The learning algorithm suffers from high test error for small values of \textit{k} (overfitting) and for large values of \textit{k} (underfitting).

\end{itemize}
